# 📈 Stock Price Trend Prediction with LSTM  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project predicts future stock prices using **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural networks.  
We fetch real-world financial data, preprocess it, train an LSTM model, and visualize predictions vs actual values.  
Additionally, moving average and RSI (Relative Strength Index) indicators are integrated for better trend analysis.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Predict stock price trends using past historical data.  
- Apply **LSTM (Deep Learning)** for time-series forecasting.  
- Enhance predictions with **technical indicators (MA, RSI)**.  
- Deploy the model as a **Streamlit Dashboard** for interactive use.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Programming:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Keras, TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn  
- **Data Source:** Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`)  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Deployment:** Streamlit / Voila
